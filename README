This package implements the local two-temperature model in molecular dynamics (l2T-MD) for the LAMMPS code. 
The package was developed by Mauricio Ponga and Mohammad W. Ullah at the University of British Columbia (2018). 
The atomic style and set file are part of a much bigger implementation (LAMMPS-MXE).

This package contains fixes that have been modified and/or created to incorporate the two
laser pulse shock dynamics ("fix_laser.cpp" and "fix_laser_reverse.cpp"). An
example is provided under the Examples directory to highlight the two-pulse
laser approach. This update was done by Mewael Isiet at the University of
British Columbia (2024).
