This package implements the local two-temperature model in molecular dynamics (l2T-MD) for the LAMMPS code. 
The package was developed by Mauricio Ponga and Mohammad W. Ullah at the University of British Columbia (2018). 
The atomic style and set file are part of a much bigger implementation (LAMMPS-MXE).

Please refer to our paper on the original formulation of the local two-temperature model: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-651X/ab309f/meta for further details.

This package contains fixes that have been modified and/or created to incorporate the two
laser pulse shock dynamics ("fix_laser.cpp" and "fix_laser_reverse.cpp"). An
example is provided under the Examples directory to highlight the two-pulse
laser approach. This update was done by Mewael Isiet at the University of
British Columbia (2024). 

Please see refer to [our paper on the two-pulse laser approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04762) for further details.
